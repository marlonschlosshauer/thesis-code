;; Pros and cons of the above code:
;; + declarative style
;; + synchronous reasoning
;; - limited effects (.prompt only)
;; - limited data structure support (.prompt allows for strings only)
;; - blocks (not only synchronous in reasoning but actually synchronous)

;; Let's try wishful thinking

;; missing:
;; abort

;; One step back
;; Implement the above process in reacl-c
;; TODO: Marlon


;; Zwischenergebnis: we're not there yet

;; What's missing?
;; Answer (fÃ¤llt from Himmel): Monads

;; Mission: Implement monadic bind in reacl-c
;; Problem 1: What does that even mean? -> Define semantics
;; Problem 2: Implement the semantics

;; Example:
(bind (get-personal-info)
      (fn [pi]
        ... continue
        ))

(defn bind [m cont]
  ;; here be dragons
  )


;; Implementation technicalities
;; Tail recursion
